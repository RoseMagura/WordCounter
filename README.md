# WordCounter

A Java program that counts the words in a text file. I created this project as a way
to practice basic Java through the Udacity Java course. 

If you run the Main class through the terminal or a Java IDE, it should print out
the number of words in the text file included in the project. 

You can personalize the program by downloading a different text file and changing
the name of the file defined in the Main class.
